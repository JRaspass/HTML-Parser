After 6 weeks, 17 alpha releases and 7 betas we are now ready to
release HTML-Parser-3.00.  We would like to thank the CPAN testers
team and especially Paul Schinder who helped us avoid many platform
compatibility problems.

HTML-Parser-3.00 is a complete rewrite of the HTML::Parser core in C
with XS bindings.  The new parser has many new features and is
significantly faster.  The speedup when compared to HTML-Parser-2.25
is between 3x and 50x depending on what you do.

The new parser interface is completely compatible with
HTML-Parser-2.25, but we some parts of an HTML document is now
recognized differently:

  - Anything inside <script> and <style> will now be returned as cdata
    text.  HTML-Parser-2.25 would recongnize markup within these sections.
    The same is also true for the depreciated tags <xmp> and <plaintext>.

  - Nearly anything is allowed as tag and attribute names by default
    now.  Previously strange names caused the tag to be parsed as text.

  - <?...> is now recongnized as a processing instruction

New features include:

  - Direct callbacks avoid Perl's slower method dispatch

  - Callbacks can be avoided totally by telling the parser to
    stuff things directly into arrays.

  - The arguments passed to callbacks are controlled directly.
    This allow more flexibility and cheaper callbacks.
    It also makes the interface extensible.

  - The byte positions of markup and the tokens within markup can
    be reported.  This allow safe editing with substr.

  - Callbacks can abort parsing if they wish

  - Support for marked sections

  - XML mode

Enjoy!
